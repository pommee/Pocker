# 👋🏼 Introduction

Pocker is a TUI tool to help with docker related tasks. For example,

- View containers/images.
- See logs and attributes.
- Manage status of containers.

The tool is heavily based on [docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/).  
A big thanks goes over to the creator and contributors of textual as it makes for a very sleek and easy interface.

## 🔧 Configuration

Upon the first startup, a configuration file will be generated and stored at `$HOME/.config/pocker/config.yaml`.

| Key                 | Default | Info                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| log_tail            | 2000    | At **startup**, Pocker will fetch `log_tail` amount of container logs.<br> Not recommended to exceed ~3000 as startup will slow down. |
| max_log_lines       | 2000    | The displayed container logs are shown sequentially, with the oldest log being removed as a new one appears.                          |
| show_all_containers | false   | Show running and exited containers.                                                                                                   |
| start_fullscreen    | false   | Display container logs in fullscreen mode at startup.                                                                                 |
| start_scroll        | true    | Automatically scrolls when new logs are fetched.                                                                                      |
| start_wrap          | false   | When enabled, logs will wrap to fit the content window.                                                                               |
